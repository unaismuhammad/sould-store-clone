This project is a Souled Store Clone Website built using HTML and CSS with the goal of replicating the look and feel of the original Souled Store website. It focuses on creating a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface that includes a homepage, navigation bar, product grid, and footer. The design is fully responsive, making it accessible across different devices and screen sizes. While the current version highlights the visual layout and styling, future improvements can include adding interactivity with JavaScript, product filtering, shopping cart functionality, and backend integration. This project is intended purely for learning and practice, and it is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Souled Store.
